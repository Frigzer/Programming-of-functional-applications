# Programming of Functional Applications

This repository contains projects developed for the "Programming of Functional Applications" course during the fourth semester at my university. The assignments are organized into directories labeled `Lab_XX`, where `XX` represents the lab number.

## Projects Overview

Below is a brief overview of the projects:

- **Lab_01 to Lab_10**: Each folder contains a distinct project developed as part of the coursework. Initially, projects were implemented using Java Swing, and later transitioned to JavaFX for enhanced functionality and user interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Primary programming language for all projects.
- **Swing**: Utilized in early projects for building graphical user interfaces.
- **JavaFX**: Adopted in later projects to create more sophisticated and modern user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To explore or run any of the projects:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Frigzer/Programming-of-functional-applications.git
   ```
